# StockScreener
Very simple JavaFX desktop widget that allows you to monitor charts


## Usage

### Window Controls

After the application is launched a window will appear in the top right corner of the screen.

* The window can be moved with the arrow keys.
* Hold ```ALT``` and press the up or down arrow key to resize the window.
* Exit the application by pressing ```ESC```.

### Chart Controls

By pressing the function keys you can toggle between different (for now hardcoded) charts.

| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| ```F1```| Bitcoin / USD |
| ```F2```| Monero / USD      |
